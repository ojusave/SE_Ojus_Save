This is a sample android application which demonstrates the usage of Branch Android SDK and its features like custom event tracking, link creation, and content sharing.

What does this application do? :
```

1. Tracks the user who visited the monster edit page, when the user lands on this page an event is logged with the event name: "monster_edit".

2. Tracks the user who visited the monster view page, when the user lands on this page an event is logged with the event name: "monster_view".

3. Uses Asynchronous methods to get a shortURL with parameters and this URL is displayed beside share button on monster view activity. 

4. While the URL is being fetched by the Branch SDK, a progress bar is displayed. Only after being able to fetch the URL or on completion (whether successful or unsuccessful), the progress bar will disappear.

5. Allows the user to share the monster details with other users.
